Collection of small scripts for processing images.

shellSort.py - pixel sorting using shell sort
randomSort.py - uses default sort, randomly selects portions of the image to sort
highPoints.py - finds points of high intensity relative to surroundings and creates a drip effect from these points
myOwn.py - almost a port of Kim Asendorf's pixel sorting processing script but not really and not complete
